# Nindows_dbg

Nindows is a Dreamcast "Windows-like" debugging GUI system used by developers using Ninja Library.
It comes with a number of functions and built-in features such as system metrics, Texture viewer, devices info, Ninja models memory usage.
In addition, developers could integrate their own Debug menus inside a "User" submenu.

Several prototypes/commercially released games still have Nindows debugging environment hidden or disabled. For those attempting to play with those features, reverse engineer or modify said games, Re-enabling Nindows can be a game changer!
